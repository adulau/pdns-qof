    <abstract>
	  <t>This document describes a common output format of Passive DNS Servers which clients can query. The output format description includes also in addition a common semantic for each Passive DNS system. By having multiple Passive DNS Systems adhere to the same output format for queries, users of multiple Passive DNS servers will be able to combine result sets easily.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
     <t>Passive DNS is a technique described by Florian Weimer in 2005 in <xref target="WEIMERPDNS">Passive DNS replication, F Weimer - 17th Annual FIRST Conference on Computer Security</xref>. Since then multiple Passive DNS implementations were created and evolved over time. Users of these Passive DNS servers may query a server (often via <xref target="RFC3912">WHOIS</xref> or HTTP <xref target="REST">REST</xref>), parse the results and process them in other applications.</t>
     <t>
             There are multiple implementations of Passive DNS software. Users of passive DNS query each implementation and aggregate the results for their search. This document describes the output format of four Passive DNS Systems (<xref target="DNSDB"/>, <xref target="DNSDBQ"/>, <xref target="PDNSCERTAT"/>, <xref target="PDNSCIRCL"/> and <xref target="PDNSCOF"/>) which are in use today and which already share a nearly identical output format.

	As the format and the meaning of output fields from each Passive DNS need to be consistent, we propose in this document a solution to commonly name each field along with their corresponding interpretation. The format follows a simple key-value structure in <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> format.
The benefit of having a consistent Passive DNS output format is that multiple client implementations can query different servers without having to have a separate parser for each
individual server. <xref target="PDNSCLIENT">passivedns-client</xref> currently implements multiple parsers due to a lack of standardization.

The document does not describe the protocol (e.g. <xref target="RFC3912">WHOIS</xref>, HTTP <xref target="REST">REST</xref>) nor the query format used to query the Passive DNS. Neither does this document describe "pre-recursor" Passive DNS Systems. Both of these are separate topics and deserve their own RFC document. The document describes the current best practices implemented in various Passive DNS server implementations.
     </t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Limitation">
    <t> As a Passive DNS servers can include protection mechanisms for their operation, results might be different due to those protection measures.  These mechanisms filter out DNS answers if they fail some criteria. The <xref target="BAILIWICK">bailiwick algorithm</xref> protects the Passive DNS Database from <xref target="CACHEPOISONING">cache poisoning attacks</xref>.

        Another limitation that clients querying the database need to be aware of is that each query simply gets a snapshot-answer of the time of querying. Clients MUST NOT rely on consistent answers. Nor must they assume that answers must be identical across multiple Passive DNS Servers.
    </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Common Output Format">
		<section title="Overview">
		<t>The formatting of the answer follows the <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> format. In fact, it is a subset of the full JSON language. Notable differences are the modified definition of whitespace ("ws"). The order of the fields is not significant for the same resource type. </t>
		<t>The intent of this output format is to be easily parsable by scripts. Each JSON object is expressed on a single line to be processed by the client line-by-line. Every implementation MUST support the JSON output format.</t> <!-- note: it is "parsable" if you want to be really nit-picking. See: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/parsable -->

While rrname and rrtype are always individual JSON primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans or null), rdata MAY return multiple resource records or a single record.

If the value cannot be interpreted, the decimal value is returned following the principle of transparency as described in <xref target="RFC3597">RFC 3597</xref>. Then the decimal value is represented as a <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> number.

			 The resource record type can be any values as described by IANA in the DNS parameters document in the section 'Resource Record (RR) TYPEs' (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters).
                         Supported textual descriptions of rrtypes include: A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.
			 A client MUST be able to understand these textual rrtype values represented as a  <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> string. In addition, a client MUST be able to handle a decimal value (as mentioned above) answer represented as a <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> number.

Depending on the rrtype, this can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, a domain name (as in the case of CNAMEs), an SPF record, etc.  A client MUST be able to interpret any value which is legal as the right hand side in a DNS master file  <xref target="RFC1035">RFC 1035</xref> and <xref target="RFC1034">RFC 1034</xref>.

	<section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
		<t>Passive DNS Servers capture DNS answers from multiple collecting points ("sensors") which are located on the Internet-facing side of DNS recursors ("post-recursor passive DNS"). In this process, they intentionally omit the source IP, source port, destination IP and destination port from the captured packets. Since the data is captured "post-recursor", the timing information (who queries what) is lost, since the recursor will cache the results. Furthermore, since multiple sensors feed into a passive DNS server, the resulting data gets mixed together, reducing the likelihood that Passive DNS Servers are able to find out much about the actual person querying the DNS records nor who actually sent the query. In this sense, passive DNS Servers are similar to keeping an archive of all previous phone books - if public DNS records can be compared to phone numbers - as they often are.

		Nevertheless, the authors strongly encourage Passive DNS implementors to take special care of privacy issues. bortzmeyer-dnsop-dns-privacy is an excellent starting point for this.
        Finally, the overall recommendations in <xref target="RFC6973">RFC6973</xref> should be taken into consideration when designing any application which uses Passive DNS data.</t>
        <t>In the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - Directive 95/46/EC), operators of Passive DNS Server needs to ensure the legal ground and lawfulness of its operation.</t>

	<t>Please note that the examples imply that a single query returns a single set of JSON objects. For example, two queries were made; one query returned a set of two JSON objects and the other query returned a set of three JSON objects. This specification requires each JSON object individually MUST conform to the common output format, but this specification does not require that a query will return a set of JSON objects.</t>
	<t>Please note that in the examples above, any backslashes "\" can be ignored and are an artifact of the tools which produced this document.</t>
